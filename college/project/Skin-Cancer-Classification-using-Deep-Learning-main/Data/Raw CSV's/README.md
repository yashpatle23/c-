### Immutable Original Data
Having a local subset copy of data ensures that you have a static dataset to perform task on. Additionally, this overcomes any workflow breakdowns due to network latency issues. This data should be considered immutable. If there is no external data then this is the data to be downloaded by the script in `src\data`.
