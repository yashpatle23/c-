# Processed
### Prepared data, ready for modelling
This is the data that has been transformed using various machine learning techniques. The features folder that we will get to in the `src` folder performs various transformations on the data to allow it to be ready for modelling. It serves as a good idea to persist the processed data in order to shorten the training time of our model.
